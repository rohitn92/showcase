<h1 id="work-title">Fipple - Social App Case Study</h1>

<div id="d-brief">
  <p> <span class="bold">Design Brief: </span> Using the process of design thinking, find the problems in one of the three briefs (Time, Change & Glance) to design a solution around it. Walk through the structured steps designed for this project course to come up with the design for your product — go through needfinding, ideation and paper prototyping to design as many creative solutions possible. Then turn those ideas into one concrete design with the help of Heuristic Evaluations. Test your application prototype, get feedback, iterate and test to keep on improving your designs. After all the refinements, demonstrate your final product design and document your process.
		<br /><br />This project was build for the final 8th course under the Interaction Design Specialization by UC San Diego on Coursera.

	 <h3 class="sub-heading"> Problem Statement </h3>
	 <p>CHANGE — Design an interface that facilitates personal or social behavior change.</p>

<h2 class="mid-headings">Needfinding</h2>

<p class="text-content">
	With the brief selected, the first task was to observe the current disposition of any scenario of our choice where our problem statement could be applied. The needfinding observation was accompanied by 3 interviews of individuals from different demographics and see how each was impacted by our scenario under observation, understanding different perspectives on the problem and identifying breakpoints and opportunities for our design.
</p>

<blockquote> The scenario I chose to observe was how people find others for any activity requiring company, especially in a new or unfamiliar social environment.
</blockquote>

<p class="text-content">
<img class="filler-img" src="assets/img/projects/fippl/filler1.jpeg">
After conducting the interviews, a clear need could be identified.
There needed to be a way to find like minded individuals for performing activities that might be a hobby, creative or professional work.
  </p>

	<h2 class="mid-headings">Ideation</h2>

	<p class="text-content">
		The first task for week 2 was to brainstorm ideas around specific opportunities identified during the needfinding phase. Volume of ideas was the main goal first, we would filter the meaningful ones later. —
1. Be able to explore a new place/city/environment with someone familiar
2. Connect to a local individual in an easier way
3. Find a way to overcome social awkwardness in a new environment
4. Easily find people for company during meals and explore new foods.
5. Talk to neighbours or nearby people easily
6. Make connections without any romantic involvement/dating.
7. Find people with similar taste in an activity/hobby.
8. Get to know people in the office better for social interaction
9. Find activities in an area suitable for everyone involved
10. Find people of your own age group
11. Form your own activity group
12. Get in touch with professionals in his local area
13. Find a cost effective way to look for people to work on projects with
14. Meet people outside his known network of friends/social media, but still in your locally accessible environment
15. Filter responses and avoid unsuitable company, assess the quality and legitimacy of a social contact
</p>

<h2 class="mid-headings">Storyboards & Wireframes</h2>

<p class="text-content">
	This is where the fun began! Storyboards are a great way to design potential solutions and how they fit different scenarios. It allows us to discover feasibility of different ideas, the flaws and possible success in it.
	I picked two main scenarios around which the storyboards and prototypes had to be created —
	Search for people around you based on your interest/task
	Search for local activities and groups related to your interest/hobby
</p>
	<div class="dual-photos"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/sb1.png"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/sb2.png"></div>
<p class="text-content">
We begin our visual design process with low to medium fidelity wireframes and prototype with them. Right now, we need not worry about the fonts, colors and imagery. We first create the key UI elements, the information arrangement and hierarchy and the user interactions.
</p>


	<h3 class="sub-heading"> Paper wireframes and Prototypes </h3>
<p class="text-content">
	Paper prototypes were a key part of the process. Using just a sketch pen and paper allows us to focus on designing around our main idea, without falling into the minutiae of visual design. The design had to clearly connect with our observed point of view, depict the rough app flow and how it actually addresses the problem we were designing for.
</p>

	<div class="center-photo"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/wf.png"></div>

	<h3 class="sub-heading"> High Fedelity Wireframes & Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
	<p class="text-content">
	As a personal challenge, I decided to design this project adhering to iOS Human Interface guidelines. This choice had two reasons behind it — 
	1. I had never previously designed for iOS, so this allowed me to familiarise with a new design system and interactions
	2. Nearly every application and web interface I had design so far was always based on Material Design and Card UI. So the challenge here was to avoid familiar visual style and still try to make the app feel intuitive and usable

<p class="text-content">

Next step was to evaluate our app using Neilson’s Ten Usability Heuristics.
I conducted a self walkthrough at first to smoothen out the app flow and interactions. This was followed by an in-person evaluation, where a user interacted with our paper prototype while voicing their thoughts and opinion about the app. These observations were recorded and later correlated to the Usability Heuristics list. Each identified problem was categorised and given a severity rating.
External participation is key since if we do it alone, we will often gloss over the imperfections of our own design. H.E. should be done at every design stage and whenever a major system change is introduced.
</p>

	<h2 class="mid-headings">Visual Design</h2>

	<p class="text-content">

		After working through our wireframes and our information design finalised, we finally get to our favorite part of the design process! The visuals for our apps are fully flushed out and made ready for our prototype.
Home Screen — The app divides the user flow into two main tasks
1. Creating Activities, and 2. Looking Around for people and acitivities
	</p>

	<div class="center-photo"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/vd-cover.png"></div>
	<p class="text-content">
	The bottom navigation bar gives quick access to major parts of the application that helps facilitate social interactions.
Activity Creation — Creating a new activity is simplified to a singular page with a simple form. All the activities on the app are categorised for tagging and search. You can add people to your activities, make it public for others to request joining it and even share it externally.

Finding People and Activities — A user can look around for people nearby or any activities listed in their vicinity. The search can be filtered using choice of interests, proximity, social connections and a lot more. “Look Around” starts with a simple question asking the user what they are looking to do. A user can pick any category or do a blank search for results matching to all their interests. The results are divided into Activities and People. You can tap to expand the list tiles for more information and send requests.

Also, to leverage some of iOS’ features, I also designed the Peek-Pop options for the search results screen (build with After Effects)

<div class="center-photo-vertical"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/peekpop.gif"></div>
<div class="center-photo"><img src="assets/img/projects/fippl/peekpop-2.jpeg"></div>
<h2 class="mid-headings">App Prototype</h2>
<p class="text-content">
To fully demonstrate the app flow, I created a prototype using MarvelApp — https://marvelapp.com/8egge1g
</p>
<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center;">
<iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/8egge1g?emb=1" width="300" height="601" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0" align="center"></iframe>
</div>

<h2 class="mid-headings">User & A|B Testing</h2>
<p class="text-content">
	Finally, we put our fully-flushed out prototype to test with actual users.
	A testing protocol was developed to list down the steps and roles for executing the test and debriefing the users. After the tests were completed, the results were compiled in a meaningful way so as to discern what breakdowns were happening and changes that needed to be made.

	The final task was to take one of the observed change requirements from User Testing, and redesign the app for it. This change needed to be an entity that could be quantified in a binary fashion (for eg. click of a button, use of a filter, performing an action etc.) I went with my the first change of replacing the “My Activities” Icon button with a Text Label button as it was observed during the first test phase that users did not understand what the icon signified and felt lost on navigating to the screen behind it.
Two URLs were prepared using MarvelApp and put to test using UserTesting.com where participants used the prototype and recorded the process, constantly speaking aloud their thoughts and answering the questions on the test script. This test was quite insightful and revealed that it did actually benefit to change the “My Activities” icon to a text label.
</p>

<h2 class="mid-headings"> Conclusion </h2>
<p class="text-content">
	Social apps are moving away from just online existence alone to bringing people closer in reality. If the app experience and interactions are made right, understanding the latent needs of different users, we can create a powerful product to bring people together in a meaningful way. (Hey, if Pokémon Go can do it, why can’t you!) This first iteration of Fippl was an attempt in trying to achieve this goal. More changes will come as the app is built and goes through the first round of actual use.
Beyond creation of a product, this was a great exercise to apply all the skills learnt in this Interaction Design Specialization —Human-Centered Design, Design Principles, Social Computing, Input and Interactions, UX Research and Prototyping, Information Design, Running and Analyzing Experiments — Design can be a much more productive and creative process if we follow a structured stepwise approach to it, constantly keeping user requirements in mind and designing to solve a problem with more than pretty pixels.
